# Correlation Mapping Using Coordinates </br>
Program to correlate between Weather Forecast Station and Rain Gauge Station based on distance derived from Coordinates (Latitude, Longitude) using Haversine formulae.

This program will retrieve 2 sets of data from Meterological Service Station in Govtech API end points and perform a correlation between Weather Forecast station and Rain Gauge (measuring near real-time rainfall) Stations based on distance compute using Coordinates. User can input a distance of their choice and the result will be output on stdout /on-screen in JSON format. This can then be copied into a JSON file using a standard text editor. The JSON file must be named <b>stations.json </b> to be used together with <a href="https://github.com/maxng07/SG_Weather_GO"> SG_Weather_GO app. </a>
